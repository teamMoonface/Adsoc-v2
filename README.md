Adsoc is a web app platform for SoC students to source for freelance/adhoc software development jobs as well as for employers to source for help. 

This platform seeks to provide students with more opportunities to gain more on-job experience in the field of web/ app development. By allowing students to post their resumes/ experiences and expertise on our site, prospective employers who are seeking relevant help will be able to reach out to our students, providing them opportunities to gain greater working exposure. With a rigorous searching and matching algorithm, we will be able to find the perfect job for each individual.
